        "body": "I\u2019m highly annoyed by the answers you\u2019re getting that aren\u2019t answering your simple question and instead are engaging in self-satisfied IT condescensions.\n\nNo, Jamf can\u2019t see those things you\u2019re worried about. If you\u2019re working in Illustrator, to use your example, they will only see that you were using illustrator at the time you used it. They CAN see your file system, but they can\u2019t go in and open up an Illustrator project to look at it or anything like that. \n\nYour passwords are safe, they can\u2019t see what they are. But if your company is installing this stuff you might want to start using a password manager if you aren\u2019t already if you want extra security. If you\u2019re saving your passwords in a browser on a work machine, that would be more of a concern than anything jamf can do when it comes to your passwords.\n\nThey can\u2019t see your banking, etc. It\u2019s not an active monitoring software (as in: no one can just see your screen whenever they wish, only a timeline of general actions). It\u2019s made to give IT a general idea of what your machine has been running, not exactly what it is you\u2019re doing in those programs.",

        "body": "Passwords - They don't *want* to know your bank password.\n\nBanking info - See above, possibly including legal reasons they don't want that info.\n\niCloud contents - If the files are synced to your Mac's desktop, then the software sees them as being on the Mac desktop, as if they were local.\n\nSeeing the names of what files are on your machine - Potentially, depending on what else is added besides Jamf.\n\nSeeing what's *in* those files - Maaaaaybe, at request, as part of a process. But I would agree with others here that it's unlikely, unless HR or Legal Dept or whoever says.\n\nDetecting if you plug in an external drive - Yes, in terms of knowing if it happened. Viruses and malware being on USB Drives is a pretty common approach, so security software is often tasked to detect/block/manage the use of external flash drives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe way I would treat it is that anything on the computer *could* be viewed, if it became really important to the company to do dig it up. If they're showing you a printout and it's something that you could not possibly explain to your boss and keep your job...\n\nIf they really really really needed to know what the banner you made for your niece in Illustrator on your lunch break looked like, they could probably get to that. Someone would go digging. And as a longtime IT person, that's a thing that happens because our boss told us to. Period. We're busy, not bored. And we don't want to get in trouble, so we don't poke around for giggles.\n\nI would encourage you not to save passwords, tie the computer to your personal iCloud, etc. That's comingling data that neither party wants commingled. If nothing else, chances that **you** gets compromised goes up, because it's way more likely someone is targeting Acme Inc. than you personally on your home computer. And now your identity info is caught up as collateral.\n\nNow, I'm not an HR person. Your employee handbook could have rules that are way stricter than the technical stuff. If I were you, I'd follow the strictest set of rules, to protect yourself professionally.",

I can tell you, I hate everything about it. \n\nAlso, be prepared for Apple to completely change how they do everything every few years. It's a roller coaster. \n\nA mixed Apple/PC environment is rough for the backend of things. Apple wants everything to be 1:1 user/device. Their devices are NOT Enterpeise friendly, and despite their historical position, Apple seems to hate the education and enterprise enviroments. JAMF is there to help you wrangle Apple devices into compliance.  \n\nI was \"The Mac guy\" in my IT shop for 10 years. \n\nThe best advice I have is....save your company an ENORMOUS amount of money and ditch Apple. The devices are over-priced, and you need a 3rd party MDM to make them compliant, which is also a cost expenditure. You also expend an inordinate amount of time maintaining and enforcing polices on staff that won't like how it much it locks down their Apple devices. \n\nLastly....good luck.",

One of the execs had been in contact with Kandji already who had been pitching they were a cheaper option so we reached out and setup a trial. I was very clear the only reason we were considering moving was price.\n\nAlthough I was impressed with Kandji and we were able to replicate about 60% of what we use JAMF for in the first week of trail, they still hadn't given us a quote. They had asked if they could see what we were paying for JAMF before quoting us and that seemed a bit shady. Like a plumbing contractor wanting to see your other bids before quoting a job. We figured they had standard pricing, but depending on the number of clients and perhaps multi year contracts they could give us a lower than standard pricing. Well, this morning they finally gave us our quote after we told them we weren't comfortable showing what we were paying for JAMF first. It was more than we currently pay for JAMF AND that included a 20% discount if we signed up quickly.\n\nI can't think of any other company we deal with that tries to price this way.\n\nThey quoted us mid $30,000s for 400 system and that doesn't include their end point protection.\n\nAnyone out there mind sharing what they currently pay for Kandji and how many seats? The sales rep told me they've seen people paying between $4/seat/month for JAMF up to $14/seat/\n\nJamf pro's standard pricing is $7/seat/month right now for just the MDM, so I'm not sure where he's getting numbers higher than that unless that includes extra Jamf services that we don't have and were never part of our conversation.\n\nComments on here seemed mostly positive and everyone seemed to indicate they were substantially less expensive.",

        "body": "Hard to say, I think it depends a lot on your specific situation.  Can you get hands on all the devices?  Will your company support you in making the changes in the sense that when you start enrolling and disenrolling that people will coopoerate quickly? You don't want to end up with a 6 month project with laptops out of control because you can't get people to cooperate. If you are confident that you can switch everyone in a week and the change from DEP enroll to use enroll is not a major issue then I think it's worth changing, and the savings are several thousand dollars, then I think it's worth changing.  If you're talking about saving $500, then I doubt it's worth the labor when you consider it across your time and user's time.  \n\nno specific industry regulation will support using jamf IME, it's all basic stuff you do with config profiles, unless you start getting into PCI. However if you are part of a large company where attacks are essentially ongoing you will need more detailed controls and you'll need to create a lot of custom things that scale.  For example, you might need to start forcing users to unput certain things or present selectable options during onboarding, and at that point you are using third party tools where JAMF starts to shine.  If you need to start collecting detailed logs and send those to a SIEM, or if you need to trigger scripts to run on custom events, JAMF is what you need.",

        "body": "We switched from Jamf Cloud with Connect to Kandji two months ago. So far we absolutely love it. To us, Jamf was a toolbox whereas Kandji was ready to use out of the box. We love the layout and readability of the console, even the creature comforts like being able to see details about a blueprint item without having to go to the library whereas Jamf would require you to open another tab to compare two pages. The things visible to the user, such as Passport and the agent, have a much nicer appearance and appear to belong in macOS, unlike Jamf.\n\nWe had our demo environment doing great in one week. Most of our profiles were recreated and configured within a week. We find Passport to be more reliable and user-friendly than Connect. Liftoff has worked perfectly. The user agent does well to inform the user of updates or actions needed.\n\nWe actually migrated at a fast pace. Our Jamf contract was ending two weeks from the day we signed with Kandji, and since they don't let you test the migration tool we risked it.\n\nWe had one major migration hurdle: Jamf was deploying Wi-Fi via a config profile. As soon as Kandji forced Jamf to unenroll a device it would lose the office Wi-Fi connection and the device was stranded because the deletion of the config profile removed the active SSID. To mitigate, we started a temporary Wi-Fi network, pushed it as a script, and then the Kandji migration tool would wait long enough for the device to see the temp network and connect.\n\nWe made it! Before Jamf expired we sent all remaining devices (there weren't many) an MDM unenroll command from Jamf. In Apple Business Manager we pointed all devices to Kandji. Then those devices could do sudo profiles -N to re-enroll based on what Apple Business Manager pointed them to.\n\nKandji's use of rules on blueprint items means we only need a few blueprints. We chose to do one blueprint for production, one for conference room equipment, and one for secured special devices. Other blueprints can be used for testing.\n\nKandji Prism is a new search feature that works well.\n\nIt's nice that Kandji licenses users instead of devices. We can now enroll iPads, iPhones, and Apple TVs along with Macs.\n\nI do have to give Kandji one F grade: You're assigned a migration specialist at the start. This is who provides your custom migration script. In our case the specialist only responded to us about once a day no matter how urgent. They also said more than once that they had added colleagues to our case but we never heard from anyone else. On the flip side, chat support and their documentation has been great.\n\nIf you are looking for something that works well from the start, Kandji is not a bad choice. I'm looking forward to full Platform SSO authentication support next year. (Giving it time in the oven.) Apple is still polishing it and Kandji supports it but we want to let them work any bugs out.",

You don't want Protect and S1 fighting over who gets to quarantine something. \n\nI'm not familiar with S1 but what does it do aside from execution based quarantining? Protect's built-in and custom analytics can watch for whatever sort of activity you want (launch daemons being installed, SSH behaviors, etc). Once one of those analytics is tripped, it can put a computer into a Jamf Pro smart group and call a custom trigger immediately to put remediation actions into effect.",

I could see us moving to Intune eventually because my boss is in love with everything Microsoft. He went to Ignite a few years back and MS was all about the Jamf partnership so he was immediately on board. When he got back and brought up Jamf my jaw dropped. I had wanted Jamf for years after using the way underpowered, cross-platform KACE solution we had in place. Like I said in another post here, if I were setting up Mac MDM from scratch, I would choose Kandji. I touch base with them a few times every year with a 'possibly later' stance.",

        "body": "It\u2019s not Jamf Pro, that is pretty much guaranteed. It\u2019s also not going to be Jamf Connect as it does not operate in a space that could impact this. It\u2019s not likely Jamf Protect either as it would cause problems before the update starts and would not run in the preboot state, and you would have to go out of your way to configure it to do anything involving OS updates.\n\nMy first instinct is a network tool filtering traffic which is usually what causes OS updates to fail. Guess what space Jamf Radar occupies :). \n\nNext I suggest pulling the install.log off a few impacted devices and seeing what all is going on with the OS updates. Also open a ticket with Jamf for assistance on Radar possibly performing TLS filtering on apple traffic causing the updates to fail. Other things to check would be your firewalls.",

We asked for an extension on renewal because they hadn't completed our security evaluation. They told us we'd need to sign the renewal without the eval completed or else they would terminate our environment. Not a show of good faith in any way.\n\nJamf is much more reliable, and you can get a lot more granular in the way you scope changes. Kandji uses whats called \"Blueprints\" and its about as flexible as cement.\n\nI am making it my mission to spend the next year pushing for Jamf and getting rid of Kandji.\n\nedit: One more thing to consider, Kandji requires you to keep a license on the device if you want it to remain in Kandji. With Jamf we would remove the jamf license from a device, but the previous record would remain in the UI so that we could look back on who had the device previously and any repairs it may have had. In order to reclaim a Kandji license, you have to delete the device record from Kandji entirely. Its a cheap way to get you to have to buy more licenses.",

The compliance editor template is a godsend for quickly applying security policies and the patch management is rock solid compared to Kandji. Kandji also offers less flexibility in terms of pricing. You still have to pay for 50 or 100 devices even if you have half of that and you have to get the entire suite (passport was optional before). There was also a nasty bug we encountered where even after we removed the Kandji MDM profile, the passport (IdP SSO) still stuck around and we weren\u2019t able to enroll it to Jamf forcing us to wipe it. Their initial sales rep also gave us a pricing commitment for 3 years but when it came to renewal after one, the account manager was rotated and they jacked up our prices saying \u201cI don\u2019t know that guy but here\u2019s what we charge.\u201d",

Their support is also amazing and fast, I often chat in to the same support reps so we know each other by name at this point. I found myself having to create scripts and config profiles to bridge the out of the box functionality of JAMF but the Kandji team has designed their product to just work and if it doesn\u2019t most of the time it will remediate on next check in. \n\nA great example of this was FileVault. In JAMF, I had constant issues enabling file vault and escrowing the key up to the server. I remember JAMF support sending me a GitHub script to help make it work and not even that solved the issues. Kandji this functionality worked out of the box and as expected every single time.\n\nI did lose some detailed information like I can\u2019t see how long users use certain apps for and other small reporting features but we could easily install something to bridge that functionality if we needed. \n\nIt just works and it\u2019s very easy to use.",

The basic building blocks of extension attributes, smart groups, policies, packages, scripts, and configuration profiles are like another programming language for me. The API is also critical to how I manage my devices/computers.\n\nLooking at Kandji I see a lot of the same functionality, but there's a lot more focus on the additional tools that sit on top of that base layer of building blocks. The built-in App deployments, OS Updates, Reporting, and Compliance Mapping look to be really awesome, with the caveat that if how Kandji does it isn't 100% how you want it done you will have to jump through some serious hoops to get what you want. Kandji is more of a \"it just works\" solution - and I'm well past that. I prefer a \"I can make it work EXACTLY the way I want it to\" solution, and for me, that's Jamf Pro.\n\nI'm not knocking Kandji - it's a GREAT solution, and more affordable than Jamf Pro by far. I was just jumping in here in response to the claim that:\n\n>I did the deployment alone for a 400 user company and I feel that would never happen with Jamf.\n\nDifferent tools for different use cases.

I can say we deliver, according to Apple, a best in class macOS enterprise experience via Intune.

So in my mind it\u2019s an easier management of devices vs the need to manage the Jamf service.  Pick your poison there.  \n\nOne other factor is are you going to have E5 licenses anyway? If you are, the question is does the addition cost of Jamf add enough value to justify it.  For us the answer was no.\n\nMy personal advice to you is see if you end up with the m365 subscription first.  If that happens build out a basic macOS offering via Intune and see if it meets your needs. \n\nYou sound like you\u2019re from a smaller shop (no offense there I used to work in smaller shops myself), so if the plan is to keep things basic because of limited admins, either would do fine and just see if you still feel the need to further evaluate Jamf.

Jamf doesn't require the Onboarding Service Engagement anymore, but I'd recommend it unless you have previous Jamf experience. You should also take the Jamf 100 (because it's free) and consider taking the other Jamf classes that they offer. \n\nAs far as what people wish they knew before implementing Jamf Pro... unfortunately that is different for each client, because there are a lot of gotchas depending what you're doing. For instance, if you're migrating from another platform, there's a whole list of gotchas. If you're currently bound to AD, and want to migrate to Jamf Connect, there's another list of gotchas. Maybe your users don't have secure tokens, and you want to filevault encrypt your computers, that's another list of gotchas. Or maybe the are already encrypted but you want the recovery key stored in Jamf, another gotcha... \n\nI think my clients wish they had the in-depth industry knowledge that we have when first purchasing Jamf so they can keep up with all the gotchas that they face.

Jamf is pretty easy, all communication is over 443 for the DNS name of the server (on prem is a bit more complicated though, is this on-prem or cloud?): [https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/technical-articles/page/Permitting\\_InboundOutbound\\_Traffic\\_with\\_Jamf\\_Cloud.html](https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/technical-articles/page/Permitting_InboundOutbound_Traffic_with_Jamf_Cloud.html)\n\nHowever, you need to make sure Apple IP addresses are whitelisted as well. The simplest answer is to whitelist 443 and 5223 for the entire [17.0.0.0/8](http://17.0.0.0/8) range, which is owned by Apple. This article gives more information all all Apple communication: https://support.apple.com/en-us/101555. This is required for MDM and DEP. \n\nAnd lastly, you need to actually CONNECT to the network, which, if there is no way to do it through the setup assistant currently, it will require you to setup a guest network to enroll the devices, or make some changes to the production network to allow devices to be able to connect through the setup assistant. There are a lot of improvements recently which allow captive portals and installing certificates through the setup assistant, but there are a lot of network setups that don't support this.  \n\nAll of these solutions, however, require changing the network configuration, and if you don't have access to that (and if they're not willing to change it) you're stuck with stepping outside or setting up a hotspot to use.",

However, one of the major drawbacks is that it takes 8 - 24 HOURS to send any MDM command, where as Jamf Pro (and most other MDMs) will take less than 1 MINUTE.\n\nAs someone who has extensive experience with both JAMF Pro and Intune (my previous job was managing almost 30k iPads and 2k Macs with JAMF Pro; my current job is managing a much smaller fleet with Intune), I would vote that JAMF Pro *far* surpasses Intune for iOS and iPadOS (plus macOS, of course) in terms of usability, flexibility, granularity, and reporting, especially as your fleet size increases.\n\n*HOWEVER*, the idea that Intune takes \"8-24 hours to send any MDM command\" is not accurate in the slightest, at least for Apple devices (Windows devices are a different ballgame). Make the change in Intune, wait maybe 1-2 minutes, sync the device, and it happens fast...just like in JAMF Pro. It's all built on APNS just like all the other Apple MDMs. The difference is in the *reporting speed*. JAMF Pro updates it's reports much, much faster than Intune, which can take a few minutes (example: a script that Intune deploys to a Mac might *run* quickly, but the report showing that it ran might take awhile to show up in Intune).\n\nPart of Intune's issues (for macOS) is lack of good documentation about how it works behind the scenes on the device, and where to go for troubleshooting. I've found a few \"gotchas\" that just aren't documented anywhere I can find, and I only discovered them through trial and error. \n\n* Example 1: the limitation on line length for shell scripts. [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts) shows a 200KB file size limit but doesn't speak of a *line limit* for scripts. There didn't used to be a line limit that I could tell, but one day awhile back a 2,500 line shell script I was running on all my Macs stopped running, and I discovered through some troubleshooting that Microsoft had imposed  a line limit of ~1,200 lines. I can't find that documented *anywhere*. I had to completely rewrite that script and make a second script as a workaround for it due to that limitation (which wasn't communicated to Intune admins, nor was it documented).\n\n* Example 2: Microsoft's documentation doesn't tell you where they store the local logs for Intune on Macs (if you're curious, they're under /Library/Logs/Microsoft/Intune). They don't also tell you that if you try to sync your Mac to Intune too soon after another sync, Company Portal will *say* it successfully synced, but the actual log file says *\"Not enough time has passed since last check-in; adjusting check-in request.\"* and then doesn't really do anything. It's best to wait about 5 minutes between syncing your Mac with Intune so it will do a full sync instead of just gaslighting you into thinking it synced, when it didn't. Lastly, they don't tell you that the only real way to figure out which policies are running on the Mac (when looking at the local Intune log) is to find the policy ID for the script you want to check in the *URL for the script in Intune*, then search for that policy ID in the Intune log locally on the Mac.",

So, our main Mac guy has gone on vacation and I've immediately been tasked with a few things I know very little/nothing about (nothing was supposed to happen while he was gone). One thing is setting up a software package to install through Self Service in Nomad.\n\nUsing another software package as a template I've got it so that this software will download and install on my Macbook Air which is running Sequoia. Everything seems fine. JAMF logs indicate it downloaded and installed fine. Except, the software is not on my Mac. (I realize it's also possible the software I'm installing just may not work on Sequoia yet)\n\nOne place I think there might be an issue is, when I load Self Service in Nomad I'm given an error telling me I must approve my organization's MDM Profile. But Sequoia has changed how Profiles work and when I go to look at the profiles to be able to approve this one, there are absolutely zero profiles listed.\n\nSo....What do I do now? How do I fix this and get it working? This is something I've not had to do before and I'm not sure where to start.\n\nThank you.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ie1gzvne90rd1.png?width=2162&format=png&auto=webp&s=1db0ad53ea22578ef2bdb9b63b5d79e1ea9e9397\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02ev95oe90rd1.png?width=1420&format=png&auto=webp&s=15f4d50191b46b6b19da9c26cedc7fec94e9066b\n\nThe software I'm trying to install is Focusrite Control. It's basically driver and software for an audio interface. You can grab it here: [https://downloads.focusrite.com/focusrite/scarlett-3rd-gen/scarlett-18i20-3rd-gen](https://downloads.focusrite.com/focusrite/scarlett-3rd-gen/scarlett-18i20-3rd-gen)\n\nI've seen some info about using JAMF Composer but I can't seem to figure out where the heck this is. Many Google results also seem to indicate it's a developer-only thing?   \n  \nSorry for my lack of knowledge and confusion. I've kind of been thrown in a deep end and have had a dozen things hit me all at once that I just haven't encountered before now and am kind of floundering around with most of them. Of course all of them need to be resolved ASAP or yesterday.\n\nThank you all for your help and insights.",

You, likely, would be able to do a Spotlight search for \"Self Service\" and get to it that way, too.\nFor background, are you using Jamf Pro, Now or School? For which application are you creating a package? Does it require a zsh script to install properly? If there was a script on the package that you copied you'll want to know what it does. That may lead you to why it's missing or where it was installed.\nOn that note, if you think it is installed, can you see the application's name, version and path under the Applications section of your computer's inventory in Jamf Pro? Assuming you're using Pro. If so, does the file path coincide with the package you've installed and can you locate that .app file in said location?\nAlso, you guys may have a config profile that controls whether you can or can't see the MDM profiles, so that may be what's stopping you there. It doesn't explain why you have to accept it when you open Self Service, though.\nAlso, do you have to allow applications in any type of anti-virus environment? Is it being deleted as soon as it's installed?...\nLots of potential variables here, sorry.

I wonder if the packaging template you're using is supposed to convert the DMG to a PKG. Either way, you should revisit the documentation that was shared with you on this process. Or do some Google-fu on how to repackage a DMG to a .pkg file.",

It might be just fine.\n\n2. The application you were trying to push might not be compatible with sequoia yet, and the installer simply failed.  \n\nPerhaps I missed it in a different comment. Did you say what the application was? And what version?\n\nA quick way to test your MDM functionality from the jamf console is to remotely disable and enable Bluetooth while watching the Bluetooth settings in the system settings app.  \n\nthis is done from the management tab in the computer inventory screen. The push usually takes a few seconds at most.  \n\nif Bluetooth does not turn off or turn on within a few minutes, then you are looking at a case of a broken MDM profile.",

In Jamf, go to Settings, then Packages, Upload the file from step 3.  \n5. If it shows you a yellow triangle on the list of packages, upload the file a second time to the same package entry.  \n6. in Jamf, go to Computers, the Policies, and find your policy called \"POL.APP.Focusrite\"  \n7. In the Packages section of that policy, add the package from step 4.  \n8. In the same policy, remove the DMG from the policy  \n9. Try running the policy again.\n\nSo when you get a DMG you will want to check to see if it's just a wrapper for a PKG, which it is in this case. PKGs are designed with automated installs in mind, whereas DMGs are not. Translating to the Windows world, a DMG is kinda like an ISO while a PKG is kinda like an MSI.",

You can manage your MacOS devices with Intune if you do not have too many requirements.\n\nIn the end, we stopped the migration since there were a few showstoppers which did us not allow to completely switch and, as far as I know, those are still not fixed (waiting for around a year no)\n\nOne example would be, that it was not possible to deploy custom scripts to the company portal and allow your users to download/execute them on their own. You could only do a required roll-out.\n\nIf you want to know something specific, let me know.",

You'd be fine scaling up with Kandji* or Jamf or Mosyle, but there are other decisions that will be put in place around the implementation (IdP choices, etc) that may come into play later. A lot depends on if you are *small* or just have a small mac footprint. If you are small, make smart decisions now, if you just have a small mac footprint it's likely those decisions are already made.\n\n*However their licensing is actually tough for people in the mid space. Above 250 seats they will only sell you chunks of 100, which shoots up your cost per device at 280 seats.\n\nProbably like many posters projecting a bit too much of my own current day to day frustration onto OP's question.",

I have InTune at one location and the iOS stuff is reasonable (cause all the apps are VPP) but the Mac support is a mess. It'll technically work for what they need, but it's just not consistent or reliable. Apps never appear, or half-install and die without any kind of log or warning. Anything M365 related (Defender, OneDrive, Office) seems to work ok (except Company Portal can be fussy). Everything else is a die roll. Fortunately, this place is smaller (maybe 30 Macs) and they're happy enough to hand-check-and-fix every machine they deploy (no Zero Touch here, not by a long shot).   \n\n\nI could probably \"fix\" some of the issues they have in InTune if I cleared my schedule and did nothing but play with it for 2-3 weeks. It's just the inconsistency that kills me. I'll test an app deployment on a test laptop, it'll work fine, but then a month later when a actual deployment is done, it's got a 30-40% fail rate for no apparent reason. And I can't justify my time trying to play around with it (I'm an outside consultant who bills hourly). Meanwhile with Mosyle or JAMF, once I've spent the hour or so building a deployment, it's done and works fine. Maybe if there was a full-time IT person in-house who had lots of free time, InTune would be a better fit.   \n\n\nThat or I just suck at InTune, which is very possible. I did struggle to learn how to set it up, much harder than when I was learning JAMF, Meraki MDM, Mosyle, Profile Manager, SimpleMDM, or others I've touched over the years.",

Particularly being able to force policies with sudo jamf policy to just push whatever you need to instantly was a game changer for me. I'm a bit too scatterbrained to work on one deployment and then have to wait 45+ minutes to see the results.  \n\n\nWith my recent experience I just could never go back to Intune haha, luckily JAMF/Kandji seem to be the standard with smaller startup companies which is where i'm planning to spend my time for the foreseeable future.",

        "body": "This is a VERY important topic leading up to Sequoia for two reasons: (1) Apple has introduced a new ScreenRecording toolkit and the existing toolkit will not work in Sequoia.  Why care?  Currently, most screen sharing vendors have not updated to the new toolkit (doubtful) and unless it\u2019s on their roadmap before full release of Sequoia, it won\u2019t work in your organization.  I don\u2019t specifically know if GoTo is on track to release it, I know Zoom is on-track and others are scrambling to do so.  (2) Apple is introducing a few new Privacy Preferences also (LAN connectivity like you see in iOS already, etc\u2026 these are the pop-ups the user is receiving, unless your MDM supports it).  Not sure if JAMF or other MDMs are on track to support it either.\n\nFor full-disclosure, I\u2019m the CEO of Addigy.  I\u2019m commenting on this, because I\u2019m very concerned that the majority of organizations are not prepared for these Sequoia changes until they feel the impact at full release in the Fall (admins need to evaluate the impact ASAP).  All of our Addigy customers should rest assured that we have the new PPC profiles available and our remote control does support the new screen share toolkit.  I also recommend you leverage the new Declarative Device Management Update in your MDM to define the latest OS and tightly control releases until you are fully prepared for the OS release (or limit Beta instances that may disrupt your organization).  Otherwise Sequoia is running very stable with minimal changes, just make sure you\u2019re all leveraging the new DDM (Declarative Device Management) with your MDM provider.  With DDM, Patching and Apps & Books are finally running like a dream.",

I\u2019ve been working in IT support for a few years, and at my current job, I have become the go to JAMF/mac guy. I inherited a very bare bones environment and was asked to build it out. I have worked hard for the past year or so to get it working pretty well and have taught myself a fair amount of scripting among other relevant things. I never really expected myself to have this skill, it kinda just came to me from the need of my company.   \n  \nIf you ask me is it something I have a lot of interest in, I'm mostly indifferent, but I have been a jack of all trades IT professional for most of my career and Ive been looking to specialize in something.   \n  \nI'll also add 2 questions. Since Mac companies are rarer than Windows is it harder to find a job as a mac admin? and Is the career ceiling lower than somebody who specializes in the Microsoft/Windows side?\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated.",

This could be in Swift programming / app development (which lets you keep the Mac focus), or it could be general Windows / Linux / SaaS administration (whilst still being a Mac specialist). \n\nI am in the latter camp - my shop is probably about 90% Mac, but a lot of my work involves managing AWS, various SaaS apps, etc. \nEven if your work is mostly Jamf, I think it\u2019s rare to be hired only for that.",

If you do find a role, from what I've seen, most of those roles aren't very high-paying (50-80k), unless you are highly skilled and find a role within an enterprise organization (bank, fortune 500, etc).\n\nI leveraged my \"jack of all trades\" IT knowledge into a role that values my range of knowledge: IT Manager at a small-medium business. I've been quite happy because I wear many hats and don't have to pick one specialty to dive deep into. If you've developed your \"soft skills,\" I'd encourage you to leverage your knowledge by moving into management. Most IT Manager roles start around 100k and can go beyond 2-300k.\n\nIf I didn't have \"people skills,\" and wanted to specialize, I'd recommend security... those roles also require a solid base of general IT knowledge, but you'll need to dive deep to succeed in that world.\n\nGood luck...

We are setting the profile so that users will be prompted to enable Filevault when they log in.\n\nBecause of compliance requirements, we need to change our login passwords after 120 days.  I have some concern that users will setup filevault, then subsequently change their login password, and become confused or forget their filevault password.  Is there an automated way to change the filevault password when the user changes their local account password?  If it makes a difference, we are also using Jamf Connect to sync our Microsoft logins to local accounts on the Mac.  Thanks for your help.",

After that it should just keep things in sync pretty consistently.\n\nYou'll have to update your license key once a year, and test and validate your configs against new versions every now and then, but it sure as shit beats dealing with bound macs and keychain issues, and your deployments can go full zero touch and be deployed from anywhere instead of needing to be within line of sight to AD.\n\nit will save you time and pain in the medium to long term.

Yes your users will have 2 logins, 1st one being unlocking filevault drive and second will be the Azure log in. Jamf connect keeps the Azure password in sync with the local account password so the user doesnt have to manage multiple passwords.  I cant image what your current management is for accounts on devices right now.  Its especially slick on Zero touch deployments ,it will create the local account on 1st login  to a device.  but as long as the users just put their device to sleep or set up a fingerprint , the only time they really need to log in twice is after a reboot.",

So whoever from Jamf told you otherwise is wrong. It *is* limited in what it can be used with though. Mercifully most of the time i'm dealing with Entra so it's fine. Happy to show you a full set of config profiles (sans IDs) to make it work, but dont really want to drop that in a public thread.\n\nAlso if you like having the MFA still there, you could use passthough *and* the offline MFA together, that way you skip the second entry of creds but still get the MFA, which would make for a bit of a nicer end user experience (thats just opinion though)",

        "body": "It can be done, but not automatically. At a very high and brief level:\n\n1. Setup your Jamf environment to replicate your Intune environment, for example all your required configuration profiles. Set up your Prestage to enroll your computers in to Jamf using ADE. \n2. Move all your computers in ABM from your Intune MDM to Jamf MDM. \n3. On EACH computer, send an unenroll command from Intune to the computer to unenroll the computer from Intune\n4. Run the `sudo profiles renew -type=enrollment` command to re-enroll the computer, using ADE, in to Jamf. \n\nHowever, there are a lot of potential gotcha's here:\n\n* You are relying on the user to re-enroll the computer. Once the unenroll command is sent, you are at the mercy of the user.\\* (See below)\n* When certain SysExts profiles are removed, you can disable some of your security software. Even re-installing the profiles from Jamf will not necessarily restart the System Extension. You will either need to reboot or reinstall the software. \n* You may have to do some tricky scoping in Jamf to avoid having policies run that should only be run at initial enrollment. \n* You will need to use a tool like escrow buddy to re-escrow the FileVault Recovery Key in to Jamf. \n\nJamf does offer a tool, called Jamf ReEnroller that MAY be able to help. It has been a few years since I used it and, with Apple's tightening of personal privacy, it may not work as well. Jamf Professional Services also may offer a paid solution that can help. \n\nThat being said, I tend to lean towards, a wipe and re-enroll. You could do a rolling solution. Buy a bunch of seed computers. Issue those to users that have fairly recent computers. When you receive the old computers back, wipe and re-issue them to other users. You could use this as an opportunity to weed out some of your older computers.",

User initiated enrolment into Jamf\n4. A policy using SYM guides the user into re-registering with intune for compliance, and restarting the device which kick FV back in with the key escrow. \n\nIt's not the cleanest process, but we determined it was better than wiping and using Apple Configurator to get our devices onto ABM.",

Our school network uses Microsoft Azure for logging in through Active Directory. It's properly set up for our Windows devices and Macs. The issue we're having is that once a year, teachers need to reset their passwords. On Windows computers, users are notified that their password needs to be reset and they can do so. However, on Macs, the user is never prompted to reset their password; instead, it just says \"incorrect password.\" When teachers inform us that they are using a Mac, we can remotely reset their password that is connected to Azure AD.   \nThe next issue is that the local account, which previously had the same password as the old Azure AD password, still has the old password while the Azure AD has the new password different password. We can't remotely change the Mac local account password to sync with the Azure AD account password. sorry if this sounds confusing.\n\nJamf Connect Version: 2.29.0\n\nHow many endpoints are impacted?: all\n\nUpdate: I added Kerberos and now if the password expires it will notify the user to change the password on the spot which is great! however the local account on the Mac will still keep the old password. is their a way to update the local account password when the AD password updates?",

They also had a pretty big dip in support levels when they went public (around the time they stopped having \"Buddies\"). \n\nThat said, we complained to our sales rep and filled out a scathing survey when they sent us a \"please review jamf\". Since then our support has been much better... but could be coincidence. \n\nI've recently opened several tickets with them and gotten decent responses. Honestly my biggest frustration is how long it takes them to implement features or fix known issues. We've complained many times that they seem more focused on Jamf Protect, Jamf Connect, etc than their core Jamf Pro product.

Yes, if you are only leveraging the lowest tier of Jamf support, it is a bit lacking. They will not be able to help you troubleshoot beyond what their documentation provides. But, if your organization really cares about utilizing Jamf to it's full potential, they would opt to purchase Jamf Premier Services. With that, you get a dedicated Professional Services Engineer who can help you through even the most difficult scenarios and recommend the best solution. I've worked with my PSE since I started back in 2018 and not only have they helped me immensely in our Jamf deployment, but they've also helped me learn and grow my skills as an engineer. Give premier services a shot and tell me if you still think Jamf support sucks.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, I am not saying Jamf is the only solution everyone should use. I am simply stating that support has been pretty great for us, due to the fact we have Premier Services. I am sure other products may be better depending on the size and needs of an organization.

Sometimes things you set to only execute once per computer will still execute at the next login, for example. Go into one of the records, look under the management column, and the top will show you what\u2019s currently pending or failed. Profiles won\u2019t push when your tenant is backlogged with commands that can\u2019t complete. If you find some records with failed and pending, this can be from policies set to re-trigger based on  X amount of times after failure, etc. Cancel all the pending for that record, then run a Recon (if you have hands on the device). You can force a \u201cmass action\u201d command like cancel all failed/pending but depending on the size of your fleet that could take a while to complete. \n\nWith all of that said, you shouldn\u2019t be restricting OS upgrades like this.

The Jamf instance is a VM living on our network, and has a switch routed to it that we will use to plug in 25 Macs at a time to process them.    \n  \nWe tested the process and I can ping the test Mac pro and from the Mac pro I can ping the IP of the Jamf server.  The problem comes when the MDM profile is attempted to be installed.  When I select install, it pauses for a half a second and throws an error \"Profile Installation Failed.  The internet connection appears to be office.  This how we want to isolate the Macs that we are decomming, only able to hit our jamf server as these Macs have been off our domain for a while.  OS is Ubuntu on the jamf server, but I don't think this has any weight in the issue.  Firewall rules are turned off on the end point, and are set to allow on the Jamf server, and the switch is allowing jamf traffic.",

That makes no sense, and everyone \"IT\" related knows that's true. That's not how licenses are bought in the Enterprise, at all.\n\nMac's are also a self-selecting group; if you want a Mac, you want a Mac.

        "body": "Okay, let's break this down....  I like a cruallyMacs, but this comparison has numerous inaccuracies and I dislike bad marketing.\n\nMost of the statistics on employee successfulness that they report have two major errors, from the perspective of statistics analysis.  First is that user reported data is notoriously unreliable.  Second is that they didn't look for a cause that would explain both observations, i.e. correlation does not equal causation.  For example, perhaps the employees who are willing to stand out from the crowd are the ones that ask for something other than the default choice and, in so doing, they're more likely to notice and question things others take for granted.  I'm other words, those \"more successful employee\" statistics are junk statistics.\n\nAnother way in which this article is misleading is that they hold out data about one company's results without context.  For example, they don't look into corporate culture, training opportunities, whether or not end users are allowed local admin rights, how strictly they can enforce policy, etc.   As a simple example of potential differences, consider IBM's willingness to cut off people for policy violations and a public school's.  A 7th grader breaks their device for the 3rd time?  Give them another.  We wouldn't want to exclude then from class work.  Teacher shares a password or installs software which posses a risk to PII?  I bet IBM is more willing to protect their government contracts and profit than a school principal is willing to side with their single technical over a teacher that's popular with the parents.\n\nMoving on to pricing differences now.\n\nThe cost of Windows 10 Pro is part of the coat of the new PC.  It's a few tens of dollars, not $199.\n\nXProtect is not a robust antivirus system.  It's meant to block a small number of things that Apple decides are a very large risk and easy to block.  It's also easy to turn off with a little scripting (I've done it.)  If you want to run a malware detection and prevention system on your Macs, you still need to buy it.  That removes this cost difference.  Furthermore, if you trust the OS vendors' own anti-malware tools, Windows comes with one.  So that removes this cost difference.\n\nMac OS comes with some nice software.  The PDF and image viewer came annotate PDFs, for example.  I routinely sign timesheets using it.  It's possible that this would remove some expenses, e.g. Adobe Acrobat.  However, while I personally like Keynote, I don't think it and Pages and Numbers are sufficient Microsoft Office replacements for most companies.  Ergo, this is a mixed advantage.\n\nFull disk encryption exists on both platforms out of the box.  I'm fact, while I have no experience other than reading about it, it looks like it would be easier on Windows 10 Pro if you use Active Directory.  This difference is neutralized, assuming you'd use AD.\n\nAnd now for the biggest issue I have with this article.  They compare Jamf to SCCM and Intune.  This is a false dichotomy.  For example, I use FileWave.  It fulfills all functions of Jamf and SCCM, is easier to set up, easier to use than SCCM, and is an MDM for both iOS and Android.  It also has remote desktop viewing and control functionality, even for remote users.  So this completely equalizes the differences they highlight in orange in their graphics while adding more functionality than they include in their analysis.  It could be argued that it even slightly reduces the green Help Desk area.\n\nLastly, if you're going to open the discussion to alternatives, why only one?  Higher end chromebooks cost less than a Mac, can use the Office 365 versions of Weird, Excel, and PowerPoint, don't require any anti-malware add-ons that Windows or Mac do, have a free remote screen control tool for technical support, etc.  One could argue that they'd be even lower TCO.  I run Macs, Windows PCs, and low and mid-range chromebooks and I've found the chromebooks to be the easiest platform to handle by far.\n\nOf course, this is marketing material made by Jamf to help someone push their product in internal discussions.  I don't expect salesmen or copywriters to understand statistics or their competitor's products this deeply.",

I can see that at scale they could be easier, but the barrier to entry into managing Apple products is maddening from a solo sysadmin perspective.\n   \n1. My management didn't want to spend the money on a management tool for 3 iMacs. - Not Apples Fault.  So then I went down the road of \"Oh Jamf is free/affordable for small amounts of Apple Products!\"\n    \n2. I'm annoyed that you can't claim ownership of them after you buy them for their weird enrollment program to get JAMF or some other management product. They've been purchased under various apple accounts. (out of my control unfortunately) - onward to the next idea! \n   \n3. Last I fought with it, I'd have to have a Mac dedicated to managing the macs. System configurator? Or something. Its been 3-4 years since I last looked. I'd hope thats changed but I haven't had the time to go down that rabbit hole again.\n   \n\n4. From what I've gathered the best solution is to wait until I can do a full refresh of the iMacs. Plan ahead. Create an account and jump through some hoops, Give them a DUNS? number wait for approval, then I need to make sure they're bought under that specific account. But apparently it needs to be a business account and can't be an account I made to purchase an iMac? It has to start out as a business account? Once again. I might be wrong but I know i've gotten pop ups saying something of the sort the last time I tried to figure out how to set up the proper purchasing. It told me some account wasn't eligible to be a business account. Well what the heck?! Thats the account that has the last iMac I purchased under it! \n    \nAll in all, the barrier to entry for a Solo Admin is effing annoying in my experience. I'm sure others have had great experiences with them in small amounts. But the initial experience has been pretty bad for me. Also, if anyone has a guide on how to set an apple purchasing account so Apple approves of me owning their hardware I'd love to know what I was doing wrong prior.",

Managing iOS devices is freaking delightful, since you can preconfigure app values and so on.\n\n*if* you already have a bunch of Macs and want to loop them into a new jamf deployment without DEP... that can be kinda bullshit.

        "body": "Disclaimer: I currently cannot afford another iPad, even used, for school only. This current iPad is of my property, not the school\u2019s.\n\nHere\u2019s what they\u2019ll be able to do:\n\n\\- Watch my screen\n\n\\- Know what apps are on my device+what app I\u2019m using\n\n\\- Lock every personal app during schooltime (works also when you\u2019re not at school, the iPad just needs an internet connection\n\n\\- See iPad location\n\n\\- Lock iPad with a custom screen\n\n\\- Open apps\n\n\\- Prevent me to use in-school authorized apps (ex: If I\u2019m using Notes instead of Pages, they can prevent me from using Notes)\n\n\\- Prevent me from changing the time zone (to avoid bypassing the schooltime restrictions)\n\n\\- Prevent me to use VPNs and install configuration profiles (Which will prevent me from using my video editing app at home (Without a specific VPN, I won\u2019t be able to login into the app (I even pay for it since i usually do commissions (I even did one for my school that hasn\u2019t been checked from the Principal yet, this means that i wouldn\u2019t be able to apply modifications in case some are needed)\n\n\\- Prevent me from changing the iPad name (will be stuck to my full legal name)\n\n\\- Prevent me from formatting the iPad (Restoring from iTunes or DFU mode would result in an MDM lock as it\u2019ll just redownload the profile after checking the serial)\n\nThey\u2019ll also setup a school Apple ID and then we\u2019ll be able to login in our personal ID with purchased apps etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom what I know doing this type of stuff on personal devices is illegal here in the EU (even though i know that BYOD exist). Since I think that they shouldn\u2019t violate my privacy and basically make my device theirs, prevent me from working with my iPad (Air 5 btw, I use it for heavy 4K editing, i don\u2019t have any other device that can handle this), and force me, I\u2019m willing to bypass the MDM using iBackupBot (Basically making an iPad backup, remove the Jamf profile, restore the backup, and boom, iPad bypassed locally without any jailbreak (my device is not compatible anyways so yeah). Of course, if you restore, the iPad will mdm lock itself if connected to the internet. Updates shouldn\u2019t give issues. Also, getting caught should be hard, as the device will still result in Jamf school\u2019s DB. Even some teachers, knowing my situation, came to me saying that I should bypass, if I really need it. No idea what should I do\u2026 Any suggestions?\n\nEDIT: Me and other students found out that the school may not be Apple Distinguished, as they advertise. In fact, the school isn\u2019t there in the official Apple Distinguished Schools list.\n\nEDIT 20/11/23: After checking a friend\u2019s iPad, I confirm that they\u2019re gonna be supervised.\n\nEDIT 22/11/23: MDM in 2 days. Met an IT department guy (Who works with the ADE and manages devices), he asked me if i talked ab the VPN thing to the ADE (Apple Distinguished Educator), told him that she told me that she can\u2019t do much about it and that I have to talk about it with the Apple reseller guys (who will enroll our device) and tell them to make a custom MDM profile just for me. The ADE doesn\u2019t think that they\u2019ll do it for me, while the IT guy is very positive and thinks that they\u2019ll do it, since I work with my device. If they\u2019ll do, I may keep the profile on for some weeks\u2026 No idea. Let\u2019s hope for the best, i guess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xigaxqh4zg1c1.jpg?width=2272&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d01db4a231468b26dfef09d6546a5ddd2fb7386\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mqaycygmzg1c1.jpg?width=2272&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=236f1373a0c3abe9b76fd0168014f513f1ffa532\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/892p21hmzg1c1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65e6ce8e7bd9d8471b7e7c52c5badb11ea3733cc",

        "body": "Jamf employee here- Slightly confused, as it sounds like they are using Managed Apple IDs to separate out from your personal Apple ID, which would lead me to think they are using Account Driven User Enrollment instead of the device being supervised in AxM - if ADUE is indeed in use, then upon enrollment there is essentially a school/work managed partition created and you retain a personal partition that is unmanaged and no personal settings are touched and you as the owner have control on removing the ADUE based profile at any time but will lose access to the school/work deployed items. Your Jamf admin can determine what\u2019s managed and what is not but it\u2019s not as deep as a supervised device- \n\nThere is user initiated enrollment- which is different from ADUE but that is super light touch and only basics can be managed- it\u2019s an older mechanism but it\u2019s still in use on older devices if they can\u2019t use ADUE. \n\na device not directly owned by a company or school or purchased outside of a direct sale via po at apple or a reseller has a bunch of steps to being considered supervised which requires the device being physically handed over to do. \n\nAxM enrollment is essentially a chain of custody that Apple knows a company or school \u201cowns\u201d a device so they can do whatever they need to it. If Apple knows the school or company owns it it goes thru Automated Device Enrollment if pointed to jamf or another MDM because Apple has the chain of custody\u2026 physically submitting a non AxM device thru Configurator to be provisionally enrolled takes 30 days to complete before the custody of the device is in AxM- are you sure that\u2019s what they are doing? \n\nLastly, there is no mechanism currently for screen viewing in Jamf on iOS. No one is watching your screen with a Jamf based app. Doesn\u2019t mean there may not be something deployed to do that but currently there is nothing native that does that. My assumption here is that the teacher is using Apple Classroom when you are in the class here.",

Quite simple, if you don't want to have your device managed then don't BYOD.  As soon as you connect to their resources, even with GDPR you will have to protect their data when you attach your device and policy can help make that happen.  Jamf is compliant with requirements so the questionable part is more about the admins.\n\nI would not and do not use my own device to access company email or for teams or anything else.

This hasn't been removed. \n\nThe issue with adding you in JAMF is, that the school buys apps you don't have to pay for. To use those you have to be listed in JAMF.\n\nIt seems the school just says you are only allowed devices which they have control over. Which is actually totally fine. \n\nYes they would see what apps you have on your iPad. But to be honest no one actually cares, they don't have access to any data on your iPad. Viewing your screen is only possible via Apple Classroom therefore you have to be on the same WiFi as the teacher running Apple Classroom. \n\nPersonally I would ask nicely if there is a school device that you can use instead of yours. \n\nDepending on your country there are even options that you would get up to 300\u20ac if you bring your personal device to school and unroll it in Jamf for school usage.",

That being said app catalog is the easiest and patches itself, installomater takes the hassle of packaging out of the equation and can patch when implemented with the correct workflow([auto app patch](https://techitout.xyz/2023/05/22/app-auto-patch/)). Package + policy is idea for everything else or for custom packages. \n\nAlso reach out to your Success Manager and join the Mac admins slack.",

In the past, this wouldn't matter if it was a static or smart group.\n\nWas looking at switching to OAUTH but a) Aruba says it doesn't work and need to use the plugin, and b) there is no way to use an existing user in Jamf or to create a profile based on that user.\n\nAny one with similar issues by any chance?

        "body": "Hi! Across our rather small environment (18 computers) we have been noticing Jamf saying its in trial mode when users log in. We First noticed this a few months ago but since our Jamf Pro dashboard showed the licence as active till April 2025, and none of us are very familiar with Jamf, we prayed it was a fluke and ignored it. \n\nNow users passwords don't seem to be syncing properly from Okta and require us to reset the local password in macos in order to get people logged in after a password change. I'm pretty sure this is a result of the computers thinking they are unlicensed so its finally time to start troubleshooting this.\n\nAll the computers appear to be checking in correctly so I'm not really sure what else to look at without banging my head against it. The guy who set everything originally has since left so so its possible we missed a step when updating our licence this last April. \n\nEDIT (SOLVED) : Thanks for helping out. None of us knew we had to push the connect licence out but we found the policy and updated the key in it. So far all is well and we wrote actual documentation so the next guy doesn't make the same mistake. ",

We get a bundle deal on it along with Jamf Pro and Connect. The best part is probably how easy it is to deploy as there is a built-in integration with Jamf Pro to deploy everything needed. It also has probably the best day-1 support for new macOS versions out of any EDR. Even SentinelOne, etc has had compatibility issues where they are scrambling to patch something that broke due to an update or major OS release. I don\u2019t know how it stacks up as far as MITRE evaluations against other EDR products but I\u2019m pretty happy with it. S1 is a bit more work to deploy and maintain. Not that it isn\u2019t worth it. We run both on a couple VIP endpoints.",

Syncing plans with your Jamf Pro Server is also a nice way to keep the various Plan configurations you make up to date. \n- Analytics is a pretty powerful feature. Takes some investment in learning how to write queries (this is also changing soon), but once you know how to do it there's a lot you can do with it.\n- the Jamf Security Cloud portion has a slightly harder configuration, because it a bit confusing on how to actually get the data from your endpoints that you want. \n- works best when you have a dedicated SIEM tool you're already using. Data Forwarding sources are pretty flexible for sending Telemetry Data, but they really intend for you to do a lot of analysis of events outside of the Mac Security Portal.",

I would be excited to learn a new endpoint management system, and it would not take me very long at all.\"**\n\nThat is how I got my two most recent jobs. I was doing desktop support at Job A, which led into some basic Windows endpoint management with KACE and macOS management with Casper. Then I applied for Job B, which wanted someone with SCCM experience to manage Windows devices (which I'd never used before). I told them almost exactly what I quoted above: even though I had never used SCCM, I had experience with 2 other endpoint management systems at Job A, so I knew I could pick up SCCM pretty quickly. They hired me, and I learned SCCM.\n\nWhile I was at Job B, they decided to roll out Apple devices, and I was put in charge of that (with JAMF Pro). Then they rolled out Chromebooks, so then I picked up some ChromeOS management with Google Admin. We also had some older Apple devices that were in Mosyle, which I was also put in charge of (and migrated them to JAMF Pro). Finally, I also got some training on Intune (for Windows) when we were looking into that.\n\nThen I applied for Job C. They told me during the interview that they were using Intune to manage their Macs. I internally cringed, and told them \"Well...I know KACE/SCCM/JAMF Pro/Mosyle and I've had some training on Intune for Windows, so I know I can pick up managing Macs with Intune, too. All those MDMs are conceptually the same, under the hood.\" They hired me. Best job I've ever had, too.\n\nSometimes it isn't about what you know or don't know, but what you can do to convince the person interviewing you. *100% confidence* goes a long way. You have to sell yourself: *\"Oh, you guys use JAMF? Yeah, we use Intune to manage our Macs, and I've been dying to get my hands on JAMF. I've heard it's so much quicker and easier to use than Intune, and has a lot more features, too. I'd* **love** *to move to a role that uses JAMF!\"*",

You just can\u2019t talk to someone.\n\nWith the tests, see if your job will reimburse you for it.

Our sales people kept saying this would not be a problem despite my concerns, the first minute with the engineer and he said it was a problem.

Also, we didn't really like being so far removed from making our own logic to train the agent, so Protect really worked for us because we could leverage Jamf's internal resourcing behind the product, but then also create detection rules and remediation flows that make sense for our environment.",

MDMs with Macs are suprisingly easy to work with.\n\nTwo things I can think of that you may need to keep an eye on are escrowing the FileVault keys and the MDM Activation Lock code. Chat to Jamf if you're concerned about the project, they'll hopefully provide you with some free advice.\n\nOff the top of my head, the process is:\n\n1. Get Jamf and ABM working together (APNs, VPP, etc)\n2. In ABM, change the default MDM to Jamf (and change the devices to Jamf as well)\n3. Copy current Mac config from Intune to Jamf\n4. Unenrol the Macs from Intune\n5. Enrol the Macs into Jamf\n\nPretty sure you don't even need to restart the Mac during those steps.",

If your 25 machines are already on ABM then enrolling should be easy peasy. (If not, you have some sneaker netting to do)\n\n1. Configure JAMF and create policies etc. (I like to create a top level parent profile with mandatory global settings and then create child profiles for sites or departments with what I call fluff settings).\n\n2. Setup your Auto Enrollment this will require some configuration with Apple Push Certs and setup on ABM. (Fun tip use generic accounts not your admin account... I know I know  but i have seen it too many times)\n\n3. Configure IDP and enable SSO.\n\n4. Create a Sandbox add a few machines and document the user experience.\n\n4. Happy with your setup? Congrats! Now test again.\n\n5. Have ABM auto assign machines to the JAMF MDM.\n\nDone. You can do this in two or three weeks.\n\nGood luck.\n\nDisclaimer: This is an oversimplification.",

Are you using Jamf to manage them as corporate / supervised devices, or BYOD?\n\nIf your school can spring for the additional cost and infrastructure overhead, certificate based WiFi on school-issued devices is the best way to block unapproved devices.  You'd need to make significant changes to your WiFi configuration.  This would take weeks of planning and testing. \n\nAnother less awesome way to stop this cold is to add the MAC address of EVERY student phone to a whitelist at your wireless LAN controllers / routers.  Additionally, you're gonna need to deploy a config profile that stops iOS from randomizing the MAC address (otherwise the whitelist doesn't work).  This method is a pain in the ass because you have to capture the MAC address of every device, so it will add significant labor overhead.",

A single, shared, non-exportable certificate will probably be \"enough\" security for those devices.  \n\nOnce you have a certificate set as a payload in the configuration profile, you can add a WiFi payload, select WPA2 Enterprise, check TLS, and choose that certificate.  Your WiFi architecture must be configured to recognize any certificate(s) you generate. \n\nAgain, none of this will work without extensive planning and testing.",

From the overall perspective of a company it's a niche specialized tool operated by specialists, and one that's only necessary if they want first class support for Macs. If you want a broader perspective, I'd consider pursuing more Microsoft Azure training. It's probably what you'll be using Jamf to integrate the Macs with anyways.\n\n\nAlso... Jamf isn't really all that hard once you get the hang of it, and at least some of the features could be consumed by Apple at any time (like what happened to Novell). That's not a good thing from a long term career perspective.",

This field is as deep as it is broad, and not everything is going to get you excited to learn. I've been doing IT in some form or another for a long time, and what's kept me in the industry is I've always chased what interested me. If you're really into the Apple ecosystem, or want to be, then go for it! The community is really supportive and I'd be happy to point you in the direction of some really great resources. \n\nJamf is an amazing tool and it is arguably the gold standard of Apple centric MDM. Much of what you will learn in the certification process will apply to other MDM platforms, and to macOS/phoneOS/iPadOS at large. Depending on your experience and comfort level it might be worth checking out what other Apple related certifications are available before you dive into Jamf. There are many finer points to the mechanisms behind the Apple platform and it may be helpful to be familiar with them before going too deep. It's also entirely possible to have picked up this info as you learn or experiment in your personal time. \n\nI think that you'll be able to find a job relatively quickly once you get your certification situation figured out, whether that's a Jamf cert, another Apple cert, or something different entirely. Certifications without experience show that you have an aptitude at the very least, and I don't think it's going to be too much of an issue for you in a job search. What many employers are looking for are soft skills. You're working in sales; you certainly possess the interpersonal skills needed to be successful in IT.",

        "body": "Like others have said, check out the 100, and maybe the 170 which is more security focused, if that\u2019s your thing. Both are self-paced, and the training itself is free. The cert test is $100/attempt.\n\nThe 200+ levels are remote, instructor-led classes with access to test servers. The 200, 300, 370 and 400 are all 4-day classes, with the cert test included, at $2,500/attempt. There\u2019s a trading pass for $4,500 that allows you to take as many classes as you want for a year. If you don\u2019t pass the test, you have to take the class again.\n\nThe 370, like 170, is security focused, while the X00 classes are Jamf Pro. There\u2019s also the 240 which is a 2 day class for Jamf School, at only $1,250, but no training pass option.\n\nNote: all 200+ classes require a test computer that isn\u2019t in any MDM nor ABM/ASM. The 200, 240, and 300 also need a test iPad. If you take multiple classes, you can wipe the test computer and iPad free in between to start from scratch. All classes should also have another computer (and maybe second monitor) to follow along in Zoom, and work in the server environment.\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve taken and passed the 200, 240, and 370. I also took the 300, but didn\u2019t pass so I\u2019ll retake it in July. All have been remote, done over Zoom. Pretty chill. The instructors are open to questions, and the tests are open book/note. That makes it a bunch easier. The 300+ levels require a bit of scripting so make sure you\u2019re familiar with that. When I took the 300, we learned about the api, but it wasn\u2019t on the test when I took it. Haven\u2019t taken the 400 (yet), so don\u2019t know about that.\n\nThe actual cert test in my classes have usually come in three parts: a multiple choice part, a practical part (eg enroll your test computer into the server, add a smart group, make a policy with this scope, etc), and then a couple scenarios. They basically tell you the general thing (\u201cYour boss at AnyOrg wants to display a message on all computers that haven\u2019t restarted in X days\u201d) and you have to configure the server to do that. Usually requires configuring a smart group, and assigning a policy/config profile to run a script on that smart group.",

It simply doesnt matter what i'm doing, it just blocks itself at that specific time.\n\nWhen we try resetting the password via Jamf, we are unable to do so, because it losts internet connectivity. With apple configurator, we are unable to clear the passcode because it says that \"there's a problem\", wich problably is the fact that it is in Lock mode.\n\n  \nIf we try using it without passcode, the problem continues, but when we remove Jamf (after waiting 3 hours) it works. \n\nAlso, we checked the logs, and they say nothing about that.\n\nNote that all the iPads in the school have the same configuration, and this problem is happeing ONLY to that one iPad.\n\n\n\nAny comments/suggestions are very welcome.",
